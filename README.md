Data Cleaning Using SQL

Overview
This repository contains a data cleaning project that focuses on improving the quality and consistency of a dataset using SQL. The dataset consists of various columns including Entity, Code, Year, and several mental health disorder prevalence rates. The goal of this project was to clean and enhance the dataset to ensure accurate and reliable analysis.

Dataset
The original dataset comprises the following columns:

Entity
Code
Year
Schizophrenia
Bipolar disorder
Eating disorders
Anxiety disorders
Drug use disorders
Depression
Alcohol use disorders
Objective
The main objectives of this data cleaning project were:

Identifying and handling missing values.
Standardizing column names.
Converting data types where necessary.
Addressing any outliers or inconsistencies.
Steps Taken
Handling Missing Values: Null values in certain columns were addressed by either replacing them with appropriate values or removing rows with missing values based on the context.

Standardizing Column Names: Column names were standardized to improve consistency and readability. Any special characters were removed or replaced.

Converting Data Types: Data types of numeric columns were carefully reviewed and adjusted to ensure accurate analysis.


Quality Assurance: The cleaned dataset was reviewed thoroughly to confirm that it met the project's objectives and that no critical errors were introduced during the cleaning process.

Usage
The SQL scripts used for data cleaning are provided in the repository. You can execute these scripts in your preferred SQL environment to perform similar data cleaning tasks on your own dataset.

Conclusion
Through this project, the dataset was transformed from its raw state into a cleaned and more usable form. This clean dataset is now suitable for analysis and further exploration.
